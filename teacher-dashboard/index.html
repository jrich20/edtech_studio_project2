      <li>Pavlov’s Experiments – salivation in dogs Phases of Classical Conditioning • Unconditioned stimulus – elicits an automatic response that does not depend on prior learning (ex: food) • Unconditioned response (UR) – reflexive or automatic response elicited by a US (ex: salivation) o Does not require learning, but depends on certain circumstances • Conditioned stimulus (CS) – an originally neutral stimulus that comes to produce a response evoked by a US After it has been paired enough times with that US (ex: hearing tone while being fed  associate tone with food) • Conditioned response (CR) – aka acquisition – response that depends / is conditional on pairings of CS with US; once learned, CR occurs when CS is presented alone (ex : salivation with tone, but no food)</li>
      <br>
      <li>Early practitioners of experimental psychology distinguished themselves from parapsychology, which in the late nineteenth century enjoyed great popularity (including the interest of scholars such as William James), and indeed constituted the bulk of what people called "psychology". Parapsychology, hypnotism, and psychism were major topics of the early International Congresses. But students of these fields were eventually ostractized, and more or less banished from the Congress in 1900–1905.[26] Parapsychology persisted for a time at Imperial University, with publications such as Clairvoyance and Thoughtography by Tomokichi Fukurai, but here too it was mostly shunned by 1913.</li>
